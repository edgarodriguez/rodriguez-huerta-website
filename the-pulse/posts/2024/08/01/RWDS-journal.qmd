The Royal Statistical Society (RSS) is launching a new fully open access journal, *RSS: Data Science and Artificial Intelligence*. Created in recognition of the growing importance of data science and artificial intelligence in science and society, the new journal’s remit spans the breadth of data science; you can [submit articles](https://academic.oup.com/rssdat/pages/general-instructions) covering disciplines including statistics, machine learning, deep learning, econometrics, bioinformatics, engineering and computational social science. 

As well as three primary paper types - method papers, applications papers and behind-the-scenes papers - RSS: Data Science and Artificial Intelligence will publish editorials, op-eds, interviews, and reviews/perspectives in line with [its goal to become a primary destination for data scientists](https://academic.oup.com/rssdat/pages/about). 

Published by Oxford University Press, this new journal is the first addition to the RSS family of world class statistics journals since 1952.
