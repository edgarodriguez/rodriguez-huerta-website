As part of the **Research Communication program, Mastering the Art of Research Communication: Develop your Skills!** by the [University of Nottingham's Research Academy](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/studentservices/services/the-researcher-academy.aspx), we had the opportunity to disseminate our projects using non-conventional resources to change mindsets and encourage creativity. It was enjoyable to revisit LEGO â€” now to continue exploring new ways to share research.


We are working to produce a worker-informed, data-driven climate risk and vulnerability assessment (CRVA) for agricultural workers in Brazil. Each coloured LEGO layer represents a vital piece of the puzzle: climate data, socioeconomic conditions, and workers' voices. By applying a multi-layer risk assessment, the project will provide insights into the relationship between climate change, workers' health, and decent work.

A big thank you to [Andrew Rowe](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/edgarodriguez_lego-research-communication-activity-7326563704836169729-nNRM?utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web&rcm=ACoAAALXnIQBj7BMjHxUYo2pVUVkHx9yWZc77pU) for introducing such a great initiative. 

Sorry for the terrible map, but I ran out of time and green blocks ðŸ˜…
