Ana Flávia Trevizan holds a PhD in Climate Change and a Master’s in Agri-environmental Law. She specialises in climate and forestry law, as well as socio-environmental issues, governance, inclusion, and diversity. Her research examines the intersection of forestry law and environmental public policies, while also analysing transparency and inclusion and diversity practices within financial institutions in the context of climate governance in Brazil.
Currently, she contributes to the development of legal and sustainable solutions for socio-environmental challenges at the Rights Lab (University of Nottingham).
