## [Climate-Conflict Vulnerability Index](https://climate-conflict.org/www)

The CCVI metrics are organized hierarchically in three pillars — climate, conflict and vulnerability.
Each pillar is based on indicators from publicly available sources, which are further grouped into dimensions.
Following the IPCC definition, risk metrics are computed as a function of hazards, exposure and vulnerability.
