### Project idea

This research will advance our understanding of the relationship between climate change, occupational health, and decent work, in the case of Brazilian agriculture, in partnership with Universidade Federal Fluminense. The project will produce a worker-informed, data-driven climate risk and vulnerability assessment (CRVA) for agricultural workers in Brazil concerning climate hazards. It will assess how indecent work practices exacerbate vulnerability and decrease occupational health. The project provides valuable insights towards developing targeted mitigation and adaptation strategies by applying a multi-layer risk assessment approach that integrates climate models, socio-economic data, and qualitative data from participatory methods such as worker voice data. This project supports the broader aspirations for achieving decent work conditions, as set out in UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8, and linked with SDG 3, improving agricultural workers' overall health and well-being.

**Funder:** British Academy’s ODA Challenge-Oriented Research Grants 2024 Programme 

**Duration:** 18 months (June 24 to Dec 25)
