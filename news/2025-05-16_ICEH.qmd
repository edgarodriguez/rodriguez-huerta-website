We will be attending the [2nd International Congress of Ecological Humanities](https://eventum.upf.edu/124629/detail/ii-congres-internacional-dhumanitats-ecologiques.html) to present some preliminary results regarding the interconnections among workers health and degrating working conditions. This gathering offers a rich space for inter and transdisciplinary dialogue.

Looking forward to connecting with participants who are rethinking human-environment relationships.

The presentation will focus on 20 years of health data and modern slavery records to identify patterns among areas with the highest disease incidence linked to WASH and occupational health. It serves as a foundational step toward identifying causal relationships and improving surveillance mechanisms and risk assessments. By integrating public health data with labour inspections, the study aims to enhance inspection coverage, foster multi-stakeholder collaboration, and strengthen efforts to address labour exploitation and health vulnerabilities simultaneously.

If you’re attending, I’d love to connect!
