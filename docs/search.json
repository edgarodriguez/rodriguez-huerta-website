    "text": "Enslaved in Ethanol\nEthanol is widely recognized as a important solution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in transport sector and combating climate change. As the second-largest ethanol producer, Brazil plays a significant role in the global biofuel industry. However, despite its environmental benefits, ethanol production raises serious concerns regarding labour rights, occupational health, and social justice. The recent report Enslaved in Ethanol by Reportér Brasil highlights the exploitation and unsafe working conditions faced by sugarcane workers.\n\n“The situations reported in sugarcane fields linked to their operations include workers killed in fires, forced to sleep on the ground, unable to leave their jobs because of illegal debts imposed by their employers, and even hit by pesticides dropped from airplanes.”\n\nMany workers are subjected to debt bondage and unpredictable wages due to unfair deductions, paying for their own travel, accommodation, and food. Additionally, extreme working hours and lack of formal contracts deny workers access to essential social security benefits. Some workers report sleeping only four hours a night, as long commutes and exhausting shifts make proper rest impossible. Moreover, sugarcane workers are frequently exposed to hazardous pesticides, experience severe physical effort, and high risks of heat-related illnesses.\n\n“Workers reported to inspectors that they had been sprayed on with pesticides. The plane that allegedly did the spraying can be seen in the photo taken by one of them on his cell phone.”\n\n\n\n\nSource: Enslaved in Ethanol. Workers reported to inspectors that they had been sprayed on with pesticides\n\n\nAddressing these challenges requires stronger enforcement of labour laws, greater corporate accountability, and improved oversight in supply chains. A just transition in the ethanol industry must prioritize not only environmental sustainability but also the protection of workers’ rights and well-being. Governments, companies, and financial institutions must take decisive action to eliminate modern slavery, ensure fair wages, and provide safe working conditions. Ethanol may be a cleaner fuel alternative, but it must not come at the cost of human lives, dignity and fundamental labour rights.\n\n\nShare it on social media:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"

    "text": "Biografia\n\n\n\n\nPedro Igor Galvão é bolsista Early Career Fellow do British Council e integrante do programa Measurement and Geographies do Rights Lab (Universidade de Nottingham). Sua pesquisa investiga como o trabalho análogo à escravidão e o desmatamento na Amazônia Legal brasileira se expressam espacialmente por meio de transformações desiguais da paisagem. Ele integra ferramentas de SIG, imagens de satélite e indicadores socioambientais para avaliar correlações entre uso do solo, exploração e injustiça territorial. É graduado em Arquitetura e Urbanismo e está concluindo o mestrado em Ciências do Ambiente pela Universidade Federal do Tocantins (UFT), onde pesquisa a paisagem como produto e instrumento da produção social do espaço. Seu trabalho evidencia como o legado colonial brasileiro se inscreve nos padrões espaciais de segregação, exploração e desigualdade socioambiental. Desde 2018, Pedro atua como pesquisador no Instituto de Atenção às Cidades (IAC/UFT), onde tem coordenado e colaborado em projetos de planejamento e gestão territorial em contextos urbanos e rurais. Sua experiência inclui a elaboração de Planos de Mobilidade Urbana Sustentável (PlanMobs), Planos Diretores Municipais, Relatórios de Licenciamento Ambiental e masterplans em escala regional. Essas iniciativas integram pesquisa acadêmica, consultoria técnica e métodos participativos para apoiar a governança territorial democrática e a justiça espacial."

    "text": "Escravizado do Etanol\nO etanol é amplamente reconhecido como uma solução importante para reduzir as emissões de gases de efeito estufa no setor de transporte e combater as mudanças climáticas. Como segundo maior produtor de etanol, o Brasil desempenha um papel significativo na indústria global de biocombustíveis. Entretanto, apesar de seus benefícios ambientais, a produção de etanol levanta sérias preocupações em relação aos direitos trabalhistas, saúde ocupacional e justiça social. O relatório recente Escravizado do Etanol by Reportér Brasil highlights the exploitation and unsafe working conditions faced by sugarcane workers.\n\n“Trabalhadores mortos em queimadas, obrigados a dormir no chão, forçados a trabalhar por conta de dívidas ilegais impostas pelo empregador e até mesmo atingidos por agrotóxicos lançados de aviões estão entre as situações reportadas em canaviais ligados às suas operações.”\n\nMuitos trabalhadores são submetidos à servidão por dívidas e salários imprevisíveis devido a deduções injustas, pagando suas próprias viagens, acomodações e alimentação. Além disso, horários de trabalho extremos e a falta de contratos formais negam aos trabalhadores o acesso a benefícios essenciais da previdência social. Alguns trabalhadores relatam dormir apenas quatro horas por noite, pois longos deslocamentos e turnos exaustivos impossibilitam um descanso adequado. Além disso, os trabalhadores da cana-de-açúcar são frequentemente expostos a pesticidas perigosos, sofrem esforços físicos intensos e correm altos riscos de doenças relacionadas ao calor.\n\n“Durante resgate ocorrido em fazendas de cinco municípios de Goiás e Minas Gerais, trabalhadores relataram aos fiscais que foram atingidos por agrotóxicos. Na foto, tirada pelo celular de um deles, é possível ver o avião que supostamente realizou a pulverização”\n\n\n\n\nFonte: Escravizado do Etanol. Trabalhadores relataram aos inspetores que foram pulverizados com pesticidas\n\n\nEnfrentar esses desafios exige uma aplicação mais rigorosa das leis trabalhistas, maior responsabilização corporativa e melhor supervisão nas cadeias de suprimentos. Uma transição justa na indústria do etanol deve priorizar não apenas a sustentabilidade ambiental, mas também a proteção dos direitos e do bem-estar dos trabalhadores. Governos, empresas e instituições financeiras devem tomar medidas decisivas para eliminar a escravidão moderna, garantir salários justos e fornecer condições de trabalho seguras. O etanol pode ser uma alternativa de combustível mais limpa, mas não deve ser feito à custa de vidas humanas, dignidade e direitos trabalhistas fundamentais.\n\n\nShare it on social media:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReusoCC BY 4.0"

    "text": "Biography\n\n\n\n\nPedro Igor Galvão is a British Council Early Career Fellow and a member of the Measurement and Geographies Programme at the Rights Lab (University of Nottingham). His research explores how forced labour and deforestation in the Brazilian Legal Amazon are spatially expressed through unequal landscape transformations. He integrates GIS, satellite imagery, and socio-environmental indicators to assess correlations between land use, exploitation, and territorial injustice. He holds a degree in Architecture and Urbanism and is completing a Master’s in Environmental Sciences at the Federal University of Tocantins (UFT), where he investigates landscape as both product and instrument of the social production of space. His work reveals how Brazil’s colonial legacy is inscribed in spatial patterns of segregation, exploitation, and socio-environmental inequality. Since 2018, Pedro has worked as a researcher at the Instituto de Atenção às Cidades (IAC/UFT), where he has coordinated and contributed to planning and territorial management projects across urban and rural contexts. His experience includes the development of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (PlanMobs), Municipal Master Plans, Environmental Licensing Reports, and regional-scale masterplans. These initiatives integrate academic research, technical consultancy, and participatory methods to support democratic territorial governance and spatial justice."
