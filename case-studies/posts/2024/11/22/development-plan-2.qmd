## Summing it up

We end where we began in the first article of our series. Through this four-part series, we introduced a Curated Data Enterprise (CDE) Framework (see @fig-cde)  that can guide the development and dissemination of statistics broadly applicable to addressing social and economic issues while ensuring replicability and reusability. The CDE provides the scaffold for scaling the statistical product development of interest to the US Census Bureau and broadly applies to official statistics agencies [@keller2022bold]. We illustrated this through a use case on climate resiliency of skilled nursing facilities, highlighting the replicability and reusability of the capabilities that would benefit inclusion in a CDE.

![The CDE Framework starts with the purposes & uses of the statistical products. The outer rectangle identifies the guiding principles for ethical, transparent, reproducible statistical product development and dissemination.

As noted in the first three articles, the process begins with articulating purposes and uses through stakeholder engagement and continues by leveraging that engagement, including subject matter expertise, to inform statistical product development. Eliciting purposes and uses from stakeholders and data users is facilitated by asking questions such as:  

1.  What questions keep you awake at night because you don’t have data insights to address them? What are those purposes and uses that you need statistical products to support?

2.  How do we collaborate and engage with you to better understand your needs and help you identify gaps in understanding regarding purpose and use?

3.  How do we prioritize what statistical products to develop first?

Examples of purposes and uses that drive new statistical products include accurately measuring gig employment [@salvo2022gig], migration due to extreme climate events [@salvo2022migration], the various dimensions of housing affordability [@wu2023housing], and addressing the undercount of young children [@Salvo2023children]. Other topics that require multiple sources and types of data include creating a household living budget based on the minimum necessary to ensure an adequate standard of living [@lancaster2023HLB] and using this budget as a starting point for measuring insecurity across components such as food or housing [@montalvo2023].

## Developing an end-to-end (E2E) curation system

Purposes and uses defined in use cases are important to support the rapid development of statistical products. These use cases will capture the imagination of those working to address today’s critical issues and advance public understanding and trust in federal statistics. The above paragraph provides examples of purposes and uses for which we have developed use cases.

Use cases are a powerful mechanism to promote methodological research to develop and implement capabilities needed in a CDE. The objectives are to undertake research projects that have the potential to create statistical products with explicit purposes and uses that will exercise the end-to-end (E2E) curation components.

When implemented, these proposed use cases will demonstrate a sequence of capabilities needed to build the CDE, such as agile data discovery, reusing modules and data (including synthetic data), tracking the provenance of collected and generated data, reusing synthetic data and methods to integrate many types of data, conducting statistical analysis involving heterogeneous data integration, and reviewing data and statistical results with an equity and ethics lens. These steps will be captured in an end-to-end curation system.

1.  **Criteria for developing and evaluating use cases that will uncover the capabilities and research necessary to develop the CDE**

Criteria are needed to evaluate, and partner with researchers and stakeholders in developing and implementing the capabilities to capture in the CDE. The choice of use cases, when curated, needs to provide unique insight into CDE capabilities and statistical product development. The capabilities to be developed include addressing some purpose and use that no single source of information can resolve, generating practical diagnostics to improve existing methods, creating pilot software, and validating new and improved statistical products. These criteria, developed through listening sessions and discussions with experts, guide the prioritization and selection of use cases and their evaluation after curation (see Table 2) [@keller2022bold].

2.  **An end-to-end curation process**

Curation is an end-to-end process defined by the context of the purposes and uses that document the decisions and trade-offs at each step in the CDE Framework. The following curation definition will be used as it serves the CDE's vision.

***Curation*** involves documenting, for each statistical product, the **inputs** from which the product is derived, the **wrangling** used to transform the information into product, and the **statistical product** itself. Purposes and uses provide the context for each statistic and statistical product.

This definition has evolved from numerous stakeholder discussions via listening sessions and discussions with Census Bureau staff. [@nusser2024curation; @faniel2019context; @nasem2022transparency].

As use cases are curated, the CDE capabilities will evolve to quickly develop statistical products. These curated use cases are integral to developing an E2E curation process for the CDE.  

3.  **Invitation to contribute purpose and use ideas for developing new statistical products**

The CDE development aims to curate a significant number of use cases that address social and economic issues that have the potential to define capabilities to be built in the CDE. Initially, they are seeking ideas for purposes and uses to define these use cases and statistical products.

The skilled nursing facility use case included code, data, and documentation to calculate the probability of workers getting to work during a weather event, resilience indicators at the county or sub-county level, alternative skilled nursing home deficiency measures, and other capabilities.

**Incorporating capabilities in the CDE**

To accelerate the development of statistical products, the Census Bureau will develop use cases to articulate and create CDE capabilities. This requires identifying those valuable nuggets for learning and quickly translating and incorporating this information into the CDE. Examples of critical capabilities of interest are learning about the utility of synthetic data, the ability to aggregate data into custom geographies, and combining different units of analysis. The expected outcome is the creation of an innovative 21^st^ Century Census Curated Data Enterprise focused on purposes and uses that overcome the limitations and challenges of today’s survey-alone model.  

The 21^st^ Century Census Curated Data Enterprise development presents an opportunity for researchers to help drive the development of the CDE as the foundation for creating new statistical products. The US Census Bureau is seeking ideas for purposes and uses that will define new statistical products. They are interested in research projects (use cases) that are guided by the CDE framework as potential new statistical products. They want to learn from and understand your experiences in using the CDE framework, for example, what worked well, what challenges you faced, how each step in the framework was curated, and what capabilities are replicable and reusable for developing and enhancing statistical products.
