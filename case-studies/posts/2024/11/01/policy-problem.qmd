## Introduction

Two centuries ago, when the Framers of the US Constitution laid the cornerstone for the federal statistical system, they could not have imagined the complexity of questions future generations would want to ask or the variety of data sources available to address them. Back in 1787, counting the population and apportioning state seats in the House of Representatives were the most urgent tasks before the young nation, and so a requirement for a decennial census was written into the Constitution. Now, 233 years later, the census continues to serve its original purpose – but purposes and uses for census data have exploded.

Questions we now seek to answer go beyond what the census (or surveys) alone can hope to address. Even with the multitude of other surveys commissioned by today’s US Census Bureau, researchers and policymakers find themselves looking to novel sources of data – from structured numeric data in traditional databases to unstructured text documents scraped from the internet – to explore issues such as understanding how prepared nursing homes and communities are for extreme climate events,eg, hurricanes, wildfires, or floods. Wrangling these sources with traditionally designed data, such as censuses and surveys, can fill data gaps, improve the quality and usefulness of statistical products, speed up their dissemination, and inspire the creation of new types of statistical products.

That is the impetus for developing the Curated Data Enterprise (CDE), an innovation in data science aimed at creating statistical products from all data types and building the infrastructure to support them. The Curated Data Enterprise, as the name implies, includes an end-to-end curation model to capture the complete statistical product development process. The CDE is designed to enable data discovery and retrieval, data quality assessment across multiple and diverse sources of information, and the reuse of data and models over time to accelerate statistical product development. The US Census Bureau has partnered with the University of Virginia, a working group of former Census Bureau Directors, a Communication Director, and university, non-profit and industry experts to develop this approach.

## The US [Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/)

The US Census Bureau provides the latest official statistics, facts, and figures about America's people, places, and economy. It collects data for 130 surveys annually and the decennial census that gives the Bureau its name. The US Census Bureau collects data from households, businesses, governments and non-profit organizations. For each survey, tabulations and margins of error are published in news releases and reports. Public-use microdata subject to disclosure rules are provided for household and demographic surveys. Microdata for economic and household surveys, without disclosure rules applied, are accessible to researchers through the [Federal Statistical Research Data Centers](https://www.census.gov/about/adrm/fsrdc.html).

Statistical agencies in other countries are also modernizing their surveys and statistical product development. See a summary of selected countries [@Lanman2023].

## A new approach

To realize the CDE vision, the development of statistical products will address stakeholder questions using all data types – designed surveys and censuses, public and private administrative data, opportunity data scraped from the internet and procedural data [@keller2022bold]. This new approach aligns with the US Census Bureau’s modernization and transformation [@thieme2022technology] while maintaining the fundamental responsibilities of statistical agencies [@management2023fundamentals]. It is also consistent with a conclusion by the NASEM *Panel on the Implications of Using Multiple Data Sources for Major Survey Programs*: 'The quality of statistics produced from multiple data sources depends on properties of the individual sources as well as the methods used to combine them. A new framework of quality standards and guidelines is needed to evaluate such data sources’ fitness for use' [@NASEM2023, page 192].

The CDE approach provides such a framework to address many of the challenges that official statistics face today, as well as demonstrate that they are poised to adopt a new approach to producing official statistics. For example:

-   The timeliness and frequency of our official statistics are insufficient when there are shocks to the economy, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, when retrospective survey data were of limited usefulness. Federal agencies responded during the pandemic with relevance and agility by creating and launching fast-response Household Pulse Surveys that met immediate needs for data, trading off timeliness for quality [@Groshen2021Future]. Public engagement and support for these new relevant and timely data products at a time of crisis were essential to the success of this new statistical product.

-   The policy environment has responded to technological, social, and survey changes by encouraging efficient use of existing data, reuse, sharing and furthering open data principles. Researchers are now creating innovative statistical products using multiple data sources to better address the US's needs and interests. The Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking [@abraham2018promise] and the Federal Data Strategy [@FedDataStrat] recommendations encourage agencies to permit access to data to undertake evaluation and research studies.

-   Techniques such as rapid scanning, text recognition, user-friendly uploads, and new devices, sensors, and systems can now record and transcribe data in real time. Using these techniques, governments and corporations now routinely and instantaneously collect and store data on behaviors and states as varied as purchase transactions, climate and road conditions, healthcare plan utilization, and land use and zoning. Extensive digitization and recording, better system connectedness and interactivity, and increased human-computer interaction can result in faster data accumulation, enhancing the usability of private and public administrative data while maintaining privacy and confidentiality [@brady2019challenge; @jarmin2019evolving].  

-   New techniques and data sources can transform statistical agencies 'from the 20th-century survey-centric model to a 21st-century model that blends structured survey data with administrative and unstructured alternative digital data sources', leading to better measures of the gig economy, retail sales, healthcare, workforce, and tools and methods to integrate multiple data sources while maintaining privacy and confidentiality [@jarmin2019evolving].

The next three articles in this series will:

-   provide an overview of the CDE and its corresponding framework

-   put the CDE Framework into practice through a demonstration use case on the resilience of skilled nursing facilities

-   describe our next steps for developing the CDE through a use case research program.
